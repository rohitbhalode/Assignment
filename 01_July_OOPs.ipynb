    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "Ans: An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. Python is an object-oriented programming language that stresses objects i.e. it mainly emphasizes functions. Python Objects are basically an encapsulation of data variables and methods acting on that data into a single entity."

    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure, attributes, and behaviors that objects of that class will have. A class acts as a user-defined data type and serves as a logical container for related data and functions (methods) that operate on that data. Once a class is defined, you can create multiple instances (objects) of that class, each with its own unique state and behavior. "

    "Ans : \n",
    "Class Variables:\n",
    "                Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any methods.They are shared by all instances (objects) of the class.Class variables are typically used to store data that is common to all objects of the class.Any modification to a class variable affects all instances of the class.To access a class variable, you can use the class name or the instance name (though accessing through the class name is more common).\n",
    "                \n",
    "Instance Variables:\n",
    "Instance variables are defined within the class's methods, usually within the constructor (__init__) method.Each instance (object) of the class has its own copy of instance variables.Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each object of the class.Modifying an instance variable only affects the specific instance to which it belongs, and it doesn't affect other instances of the class.To access an instance variable, you can use the instance name (object name).

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "Ans: The primary purpose of the self parameter is to access and manipulate the instance variables (attributes) of the object within the class methods. It allows the method to interact with the specific instance of the class and its unique data.It is a convention and not a keyword, but it is widely used and recommended to use self as the first parameter name in instance methods (regular methods) within a class "
